Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         3,377 out of   9,312   36%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             5,159 out of   9,312   55%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          3,631 out of   4,656   77%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   3,631 out of   3,631 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   3,631   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       5,503 out of   9,312   59%
    Number used as logic:             5,055
    Number used as a route-thru:        344
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      16
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      88

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
